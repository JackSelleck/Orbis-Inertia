							<p>I am the Foley artist, responsible for recording, editing and implementing sounds. Each sound I created is used across the environment, as I've tried to make sure that everything has a designated sound.</p>

							<p>Throughout this project, my job & role was to edit and implement the sounds. Id attempt to make/ edit each sound with my peers feedback and the overall asset in mind. When implementing, I needed to write a breif amount of code to make sure each sound played correctly.</p>

							<p>I believe that I have done a lot of adujsting to my implementations, as I've tried to make sure that they fit into the game, whilst also fitting into my teammates and play testers expectations.</p></h3>

							<p>During this process, I have enjoyed my time working on this, as I've spent time working on a role that I like, with my peers, and pick up on a few additional skills along the way, which I feel is super helpufl & inshightful. However, I feel as though I could've created more high quality sounds, as I feel this would have enhanced the game even more.</p></h3>
